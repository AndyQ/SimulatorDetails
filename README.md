Purpose
--------------

With Xcode 6 and iOS 8, Apple changed the way that application binaries and their associated data folders are stored.

Now, each redeploy of an app causes the app binary to have a different folder and also its data folder. This makes locating saved documents somewhat challenging.

SimulatorDetails is a simple Mac app that will enable you to open the app and data folder for an iOS 8 Simulator app.


Supported OS & SDK Versions
-----------------------------

* Supported build target - Mac OS 10.10 (Xcode 6.1, Apple LLVM compiler 6.0)

NOTE: 'Supported' means that the app has been tested with this version. It may work with other versions but I haven't tested that.  Also, it currently only works with iOS 8 simulator files.
